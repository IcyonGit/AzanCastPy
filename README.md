# Azan Casting Script

This is a Python script that will cast the **Azan** to all Chromecast devices on your network when it is time for prayer.

This script is designed to run on a **Raspberry Pi** with the latest version of **Pi OS** (I use the Lite version). Other Linux distributions should work the same way.  
Windows, however, does not have an install command. If you wish to use **Windows**, you must install and run the script and its dependencies manually.

## Installation

To install the script on **Linux**, use the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IcyonGit/AzanCastPy/main/install.sh | bash
