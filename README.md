This is a Python script that will cast the azan to all Chromecast devices on your network when it is time for prayer.

this is made to run on a Raspberry Pi with the latest version of Pi OS (I use lite). Other versions of Linux should work the same. Windows does not have an install command,
if you wish to use Windows, you must install and run the script and its dependencies manually.
